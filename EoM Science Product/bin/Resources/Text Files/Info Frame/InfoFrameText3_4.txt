The large land structure that resides within the North Pole. Ever since the year 2000, the ice caps has began cracking and breaking into pieces, shrinking the entire frozen mass.
Humans have caused the extinctions of hundreds of species in the recent centuries, one example being the passenger pigeon. Global warming is the result of the continuous combustion of fossil fuels, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Snow and ice usually form a protective layer over the arctic to reduce heat. When the ice caps shrink, the Earth absorbs more heat from the Sun, speeding up global warming in the process. With the ice caps melting, cities and areas near sea level are in risk of flooding from  rising sea levels.
