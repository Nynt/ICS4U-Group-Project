The combined mass of all water found on Earth. The majority of this water is salt water found in the oceans, while fresh water is mostly trapped in frozen glaciers. The hydrosphere undergoes a frequent water cycle, where liquid water evaporates into vapour and flows to new locations. The vapour then condenses and falls back down to Earth as precipitation.
The measurement of salt concentration within the ocean. Ocean salinity is the drives the currents that occur within the ocean itself through shifts in seawater density. When the surface water reaches a certain density of salt, the heavier water will sink down to the bottom of the ocean and get replaced by lighter water, creating an ocean current. This current allows for heat to be transferred around to colder climates and cool air to warmer climates.
The amount of energy it requires to raise one gram of a substance by 1O Celsius. Every substance has a different heat capacity, which determines how easily that substance gains and loses heat.
Due to their high specific capacity, it takes a lot of energy in order to raise the temperature of water, making it even more difficult to significantly change the temperature of a large body of water. This results in the temperature of a body of water to be closer to SATP throughout the year compared to bodies of land. The body of water then moderates the temperature of the nearby land, increasing the temperature during winter and decreasing the temperature during summer.
